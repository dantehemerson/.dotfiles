# this is the configuration file for ghostty.
#
# this templatmonokai pro octagone file has been automatically created at the following
# path since ghostty couldn't find any existing config files on your system:
#
#   /users/d/library/application support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config
#
# the template does not set any default options, since ghostty ships
# with sensible defaults for all options. users should only need to set
# options that they want to change from the default.
#
# run `ghostty +show-config --default --docs` to view a list of
# all available config options and their default values.
#
# additionally, each config option is also explained in detail
# on ghostty's website, at https://ghostty.org/docs/config.
#
# ghostty can reload the configuration while running by using the menu
# options or the bound key (default: command + shift + comma on macos and
# control + shift + comma on other platforms). not all config options can be
# reloaded while running; some only apply to new windows and others may require
# a full restart to take effect.
